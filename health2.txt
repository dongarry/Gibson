Disabled people have become prisoners in their own home due to cuts in welfare payments and support services, it was claimed today.Ten leading organisations have demanded that the Government should recognise the social and care needs of people with a disability or mental health problem in December's austerity Budget.The umbrella groups - which represent 800,000 people with disabilities - argued there is no Croke Park Agreement to protect service users across the country.John Dolan, of the Disability Federation of Ireland, said 18.5pc of the population have a disability - with the percentage increasing as people age. "Disability is not a sectoral issue, it is a social issue," he said.
"The Taoiseach (Enda Kenny), the Tanaiste (Eamon Gilmore) and the Programme for Government have named people with disabilities, including mental health, as the Government's social justice priority. "There is no plan how to protect people (with a disability) from the cradle to the grave," he added.
