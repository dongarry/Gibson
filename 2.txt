1) Create Account Information

Become the root user.


sudo -s

-- Install PHP - crucial!
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

sudo apt-get install build-essential


Create a new nagios user account and give it a password.


/usr/sbin/useradd -m -s /bin/bash nagios

passwd nagios

On older Ubuntu server editions (6.01 and earlier), you will need to also add a nagios group (it's not created by default). You should be able to skip this step on desktop, or newer server editions of Ubuntu.


/usr/sbin/groupadd nagios

/usr/sbin/usermod -G nagios nagios

Create a new nagcmd group for allowing external commands to be submitted through the web interface. Add both the nagios user and the apache user to the group.


/usr/sbin/groupadd nagcmd

/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios

/usr/sbin/usermod -a -G nagcmd www-data

2) Download Nagios and the Plugins

Create a directory for storing the downloads.


mkdir ~/downloads

cd ~/downloads

Download the source code tarballs of both Nagios and the Nagios plugins (visit http://www.nagios.org/download/ for links to the latest versions). These directions were tested with Nagios 3.1.1 and Nagios Plugins 1.4.11.


4) Customize Configuration

Sample configuration files have now been installed in the /usr/local/nagios/etc directory. These sample files should work fine for getting started with Nagios. You'll need to make just one change before you proceed...

Edit the /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg config file with your favorite editor and change the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to the address you'd like to use for receiving alerts.


vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

5) Configure the Web Interface

Install the Nagios web config file in the Apache conf.d directory.


make install-webconf

Create a nagiosadmin account for logging into the Nagios web interface. Remember the password you assign to this account - you'll need it later.


htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.


/etc/init.d/apache2 reload

 Note: Consider implementing the ehanced CGI security measures described here to ensure that your web authentication credentials are not compromised.

6) Compile and Install the Nagios Plugins

Extract the Nagios plugins source code tarball.


cd ~/downloads

tar xzf nagios-plugins-1.4.11.tar.gz

cd nagios-plugins-1.4.11

Compile and install the plugins.


./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios

make

make install

7) Start Nagios

Configure Nagios to automatically start when the system boots.


ln -s /etc/init.d/nagios /etc/rcS.d/S99nagios

Verify the sample Nagios configuration files.


/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

If there are no errors, start Nagios.


/etc/init.d/nagios start

8) Login to the Web Interface

You should now be able to access the Nagios web interface at the URL below. You'll be prompted for the username (nagiosadmin) and password you specified earlier.


http://localhost/nagios/


9) Other Modifications

If you want to receive email notifications for Nagios alerts, you need to install the mailx (Postfix) package.


sudo apt-get install mailx

sudo apt-get install postfix

You'll have to edit the Nagios email notification commands found in /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg and change any '/bin/mail' references to '/usr/bin/mail'. Once you do that you'll need to restart Nagios to make the configuration changes live.


sudo /etc/init.d/nagios restart

wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagios/nagios-3.2.3.tar.gz

wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/nagiosplug/nagios-plugins-1.4.11.tar.gz

3) Compile and Install Nagios

Extract the Nagios source code tarball.


cd ~/downloads

tar xzf nagios-3.2.3.tar.gz

cd nagios-3.2.3

Run the Nagios configure script, passing the name of the group you created earlier like so:


./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd

Compile the Nagios source code.


make all

Install binaries, init script, sample config files and set permissions on the external command directory.


make install

make install-init

make install-config

make install-commandmode
