PEOPLE who get up early in the morning are slimmer, happier and healthier than those who lie in, researchers have found. Those who fight the urge to ignore the alarm clock complete morning chores faster, pack their children off to school earlier and thrive in the workplace, researchers concluded.But people who can't resist a lie in have a higher chance of feeling depressed or stressed and becoming overweight.Researchers questioned 1,068 adults about their levels of happiness and anxiety, their physical health and their eating and sleeping habits in an online survey.They found that "morning people" were out of bed by 6.58am on average, while "evening people" waited until 8.54am to start their day. At the weekend both groups enjoyed about an extra hour under the covers, with early risers waiting until 7.47am to get up and night owls lying in until 10.09am.
